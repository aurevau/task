# Task- Android
This project is an Android implementation of a goal tracking app, built in Kotlin and my first time learning Jetpack Compose.
Where users create personal or group-based goals, invite friends, track progress and stay accountable through
updates, media sharing and notifications. 

The app focuses on commitment, social motivation, and structured goal-tracking in a clean Material Design UI. 

Built as a part of an Android development project as a side project.
